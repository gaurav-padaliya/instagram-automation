### 2. .gitignore

Create a file named **.gitignore** in the root of your project. This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore. You can use the following as a starting point:

```gitignore
# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Virtual environment
venv/
ENV/
env/
*.env

# Output folder for generated images
output/

# Environment variables (if using a .env file for credentials)
.env

# System files (macOS, Windows)
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
credentials.json
config.*
